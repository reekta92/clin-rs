# **clin - Your notes. Encrypted. Instant. Private. Simple.**

## Vim mode (optional)
![vim](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfa802bc-b2dd-4351-8a4b-0cea1f03ca0a)

- Vim mode can be toggled with a selectable Vim button in both notes and editor views.
- Vim mode toggle state persists across app restarts.
- Vim mode indicator (`[ Vim: ON ]` / `[ Vim: OFF ]`) shown in notes and editor help areas.
- Uses `vim-line` as the core Vim key handling engine (not a hand-rolled parser).
- Modes: `NORMAL`, `INSERT`, `VISUAL`, operator-pending (`d...`/`c...`/`y...`), and replace (`r...`).
- Visual line mode compatibility: `V` enters linewise selection, `j`/`k` extends, `y`/`d`/`c`/`x`/`p` applies.
- Motions/navigation: `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `w`, `e`, `b`, `0`, `^`, `$`, `%`.
- Operator motions: `d`, `y`, `c` with combinations like `dw`, `cw`, `yw`, plus `dd`, `yy`, `cc`.
- Inner object compatibility operators:
  - Change inner: `ciw`, `ci(`, `ci[`, `ci{`, `ci<`, `ci"`, `ci'`, `ci``
  - Delete inner: `diw`, `di(`, `di[`, `di{`, `di<`, `di"`, `di'`, `di``
  - Yank inner: `yiw`, `yi(`, `yi[`, `yi{`, `yi<`, `yi"`, `yi'`, `yi``
- Additional Vim edit actions: `x`, `D`, `C`, `r<char>`, `p`, `P`.

# Quick actions!

## 🔐 Storage & Security
Notes are encrypted before hitting disk.  
Key is stored locally (`key.bin`).  
**Backup & Restore** -> copy both `.clin` files + `key.bin` from `~/.local/share/clin`
